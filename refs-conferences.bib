  abstract = {Choosing techniques for real, messy data is often outside the scope of what researchers learn in introductory statistics courses, even at the graduate level. University of Oklahoma Libraries' internal listening sessions (2021) found faculty see a need for statistical help at OU. Existing statistical help resources include self-directed or guided search using books and papers, direct human interaction through collaborators, mentors, consultants, and online forums, and instructive sources such as university courses. The existing solutions cost researchers social capital (i.e., access to collaborators, mentors, or librarians), which is not equitably distributed, or financial costs to the individual, grant, or institution that are not available to all researchers (such as statistical consulting). Most sources also vary in usefulness. Statistics Helper is a proposed interactive website to guide users to suitable statistical resources. This tool will ask users questions about their goals and dataset to narrow down a curated list of resources and short glossary definitions, which will be presented to the user throughout the process -- imagine TurboTax for datasets. Statistics Helper will empower researchers in the data analysis process by asking non-technical questions to focus their reading on carefully curated choices so they can make informed decisions about their analyses.},
