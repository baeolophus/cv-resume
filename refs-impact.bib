When our neighbors thrive, we all do. This Earth Day, we're showing scenes of native species that UL team members have planted in their yards and gardens. We're also providing some information about the plant and how it supports biodiversity and the environment. ``Planting native species is important because they're the backbone of the natural ecosystem. A plant or tree native to the region hosts a much greater variety of bugs and other food for non-invasive birds, thereby increasing the biodiversity in your area. So, it's not about keeping the fancy, ornamental, non-native plants out for the sake of it; it's about helping our neighbor creatures and habitats have what they need to survive,'' says Claire Curry, a science librarian at OU Libraries. Native species = more bugs and seeds that feed native birds = more native birds = more owls and hawks, and on and on. So, this Earth Day, try it out. Every native species you plant helps üíö üåç üåé üåè üåç üåé \#UniversityofOklahoma \#OU \#OULibraries \#UniversityLibraries \#UniversityofOklahomaLibraries \#EarthDay \#NativePlants \#NativeSpecies \#Pollinators \#PollinatorGardens \#BackyardHabitat"},
