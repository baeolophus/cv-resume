Hybrid zones often occur across environmental gradients; as such, they are excellent places to examine how signals diverge and how differentiation is maintained. We studied song variation across two hybrid zones, one old and one recent, of Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) and Black-crested Titmouse (B. atricristatus), across an environmental gradient where the two titmouse populations meet. In the recent zone, noise and vegetation structure were correlated with several song characteristics, but in the older zone, these features did not correlate despite similar gradients in song features. Our data, combined with previous studies, suggest that despite overall similarities in characteristics, songs in the older zone may be more shaped by sexual selection, whereas songs in the young zone are shaped by environment. Thus, even within the same species, processes shaping signal structure can vary spatially and temporally.},

Few studies examine multiple contacts within one species complex to compare how their extent changes over time. Black-crested and Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus atricristatus and B. bicolor) hybridize extensively within a narrow zone in Texas and southwestern Oklahoma. In Texas, hybridization has been occurring for several thousands of years, while evidence suggests the southwestern Oklahoma contact is more recent, beginning within the past century. We quantify plumage and morphology of the two species across both the younger and older hybrid zones and compare the current and historical extent of phenotypic variation in the older Texas contact with that in the younger Oklahoma contact. Variation in plumage between species is similar in the younger and older contacts, while overlap in morphological characters is broader in the older contact. Recently and historically surveyed transects in the older zone have similar cline widths, indicating selection, at least on crest and forehead plumage, has reached equilibrium with dispersal over the time periods involved (comparing both the historically surveyed data from 1955 vs. the recently surveyed data from the 2000s in Texas). In the recently surveyed younger Oklahoma contact, cline width is narrower, indicating potential for expansion if it follows the course of the older contact. This temporal complexity should make this species complex a productive system for future work, using plumage and additional traits such as song and genetics, on the relative influences of both natural and sexual selection on the evolution of reproductive isolation.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic noise is a pervasive pollutant altering behaviour of wildlife that communicates acoustically. Some species adjust vocalisations to compensate for noise. However, we know little about whether signal adjustments improve communication in noise, the extent to which effectiveness of adjustments varies with noise source, or how individual variation in physiology varies with response capacity. We played noise-adjusted and unadjusted songs to wild Passerculus sandwichensis (Savannah Sparrows) after measurements of adrenocortical responsiveness of individuals. Playbacks using songs adjusted to noisy environments were effective in restoring appropriate conspecific territorial aggression behaviours in some altered acoustic environments. Surprisingly, however, levels of adrenocortical responsiveness that reduced communication errors at some types of infrastructure were correlated with increased errors at others. Song adjustments that were effective in communicating for individuals with lower adrenocortical responsiveness at pumpjacks were not effective at screwpumps and vice versa. Our results demonstrate that vocal adjustments can sometimes allow birds to compensate for disruptions in communication caused by anthropogenic noise, but that physiological variation among receivers may alter effectiveness of these adjustments. Thus mitigation strategies to minimize anthropogenic noise must account for both acoustic and physiological impacts of infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Hybrid zones, where populations with incomplete reproductive isolation interact, are particularly good systems in which to study how isolating barriers evolve during speciation. Examining a hybrid zone over time or with contacts of different ages allows us to understand the relative roles of and interactions between different isolating barriers (such as selection against hybrids, innate preferences for hybrid, or parental types) and how they change with continued contact between the interacting populations. One such temporally complex hybrid zone is that of two oscine songbirds, the black-crested (Baeolophus atricristatus) and tufted (B. bicolor) titmice (family Paridae). In one region, the two populations have been interbreeding for several thousands of years; elsewhere, populations of the two species have contacted within the past century. We tested (1) if males treat other populations as potential competition; (2) if females show preferences for male phenotype; and (3) if there are reproductive consequences to hybridization. We found that older zone males responded most strongly to conspecifics, whereas younger zone discrimination is weaker; moreover, females responded most strongly to tufted song and plumage. Intrinsic postmating isolation appears to be absent even in the older part of this system. Future studies should focus on potential ecological or behavioral postmating barriers preventing expansion of the hybridization. Hybrid zones, areas where populations with distinct differences meet and interbreed, are excellent for studying speciation. Because hybridizing populations can interbreed but do not fully merge, they allow us to understand what behaviors and intrinsic incompatibilities keep populations apart. Hybrid zones that contain different ages of contact can be particularly useful because we can see how such behaviors change with continued interaction. We found differences between behaviors in the younger and older contact zones in one such complex hybrid zone between songbirds, indicating behaviors evolve with continued interaction. Few studies as yet have examined behavior directly in a temporally complex zone as we did here, so our study provide new insights into how behavior evolves during the divergence of new species.},

  abstract = {Species distribution models can be made more accurate by use of new ``Spatiotemporal Exploratory Models'' (STEMs), a type of spatially explicit ensemble model (SEEM) developed at the continental scale that averages regional models pixel by pixel. Although SEEMs can generate more accurate predictions of species distributions, they are computationally expensive. We compared the accuracies of each model for 11 grassland bird species and examined whether they improve accuracy at a statewide scale for fine and coarse predictor resolutions. We used a combination of survey data and citizen science data for 11 grassland bird species in Oklahoma to test a spatially explicit ensemble model at a smaller scale for its effects on accuracy of current models. We found that only four species performed best with either a statewide model or SEEM; the most accurate model for the remaining seven species varied with data resolution and performance measure. Policy implications: Determination of nonheterogeneity may depend on the spatial resolution of the examined dataset. Managers should be cautious if any regional differences are expected when developing policy from range-wide results that show a single model or timeframe. We recommend use of standard species distribution models or other types of nonspatially explicit ensemble models for local species prediction models. Further study is necessary to understand at what point SEEMs become necessary with varying dataset resolutions.},

Much of what we know about path integration, in which an animal estimates the angle and distance of a homeward vector using information gathered during an outbound journey, has been gleaned through systematic behavioral experiments on spiders. We focus on the most heavily studied spider models, highlighting the methodology used to deduce various aspects of the path integration machinery. We also highlight some work being done on longer range spider navigators, and emerging work with other arachnid groups. We provide additional thoughts concerning the evolution of homing systems and suggest promising leads for further investigation.},

Probability of detection varied with species and with speaker distance from transect line, but there were few effects of noisy infrastructure. Accuracy of distance estimates for songs and tones decreased as distance to observer increased, and distance estimation error was higher for tones at sites with infrastructure noise. Our results suggest that quiet to moderately loud anthropogenic noise may not mask detection of bird songs; however, errors in distance estimates during aural surveys may lead to inaccurate estimates of avian densities calculated using distance sampling. We recommend caution when applying distance sampling if most birds are unseen, and where ambient noise varies among treatments.},

We argue that each term fits within a conceptual framework that can be viewed in Bayesian terms and demonstrate, using long-term data on occupancy patterns of a grassland grouse, how prior probability profiles can be estimated. We obtained estimates by specifically focusing on whether and to what extent the Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) avoids anthropogenic features such as roads, powerlines, petroleum wells, fences, and buildings, in two study areas, one with denser and one with sparser incidence of features. Grouse strongly avoided large features such as outbuildings and tended to avoid tall features such as powerlines; by contrast, grouse did not or only slightly avoided low, unobtrusive features such as fences. We further examined co-location of pairs of anthropogenic features and found that certain features were avoided so strongly that avoidance distance may be shorter for other features; that is, birds were ``pushed toward'' some features because they are ``pushed away'' from others. In each case, our approach points toward a means to incorporate avoidance behavior directly into analytic studies of habitat selection, in that data on use (the posterior, as it were) could be used to infer the selection process provided data on preference (the prior, as it were) could be obtained.},

We found that hybridization patterns correspond to localized hybrid swarms and that the titmouse hybrid zone is likely slowly expanding over time, a product of short post-natal dispersal distances coupled with weak or absent selection against admixture. We show the southern part of the hybrid zone located in Texas is four times wider than northern region of hybridization in Oklahoma, which is likely due to geographic differences in hybrid zone age. Despite differences in width, most individuals in both transects are advanced-generation hybrids and backcrosses, suggesting geographically consistent hybridization dynamics. We documented a strong correlation between genotypes and plumage index, suggesting that hybridization has not yet resulted in the decoupling of plumage and genome-wide ancestry as observed in some other avian hybrid zones. Although our results suggest the ongoing expansion of the hybrid zone, the rate of expansion appears to be very slow, on the scale of tens of meters a year, and it will likely take hundreds of thousands to millions of years before homogenization of the parental populations. While we did not find support for partial reproductive isolation in the hybrid zone itself, there is the possibility that ecological or sexual selection limit introgression into allopatric regions. Broadly, the results of our study highlight the value of multiple, geographically distant, transects across a hybrid zone for assessing the evolutionary dynamics of hybridizing lineages.},
